➤ Q.1 (Ans) - ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is a communication protocol used in computer networks to map an IP address to a physical (MAC) address. The MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to each network interface card (NIC) or network adapter.

When a device wants to send data to another device on the same network, it needs to know the MAC address of the destination device. However, devices use IP addresses to communicate with each other, not MAC addresses. This is where ARP comes into play.

➤ Q.2 (Ans) - NAT Means Network Address Translation. It is a technique used in computer networking to allow multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address when accessing the internet. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

➤ Q.3 (Ans) - Private IP addresses are essential for maintaining security and conserving public IP address space. They allow multiple devices to share a single public IP address when connecting to the internet using a technique called Network Address Translation (NAT). This way, private IP addresses can be reused in different networks, and only the public IP address is exposed to the internet.

➤ Q.4 (Ans) - Deadlock is a state in a computer system where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another process, resulting in a deadlock situation. The conditions necessary for a deadlock to occur are:

1. Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource in the system must be non-sharable, meaning it can only be used by one process at a time. This condition ensures that once a process acquires a resource, no other process can simultaneously access or modify it.

2. Hold and Wait: Processes that have already acquired resources can request additional resources while still holding their current resources. In other words, a process can hold on to the resources it has acquired and wait for additional resources to be released by other processes.

3. No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process. Only the process holding a resource can release it voluntarily. This condition ensures that resources cannot be forcefully reclaimed from a process to be given to another process.

4. Circular Wait: There must be a circular chain of two or more processes, where each process is waiting for a resource held by another process in the chain. In other words, process 1 is waiting for a resource held by process 2, process 2 is waiting for a resource held by process 3, and so on, until the last process is waiting for a resource held by process 1, completing the circular dependency.

If all these conditions are satisfied, a deadlock can occur. To resolve a deadlock, techniques such as resource allocation algorithms, deadlock detection, and recovery mechanisms are employed to break the circular dependency or prevent the occurrence of deadlocks altogether.

➤ Q.5 (Ans) - Swap memory, also known as virtual memory or paging, is a technique used by operating systems to extend the available memory beyond the physical RAM (Random Access Memory) installed in a computer system. It allows the operating system to temporarily store inactive or less frequently used data from RAM onto the hard disk or SSD (Solid State Drive), freeing up physical memory for more active processes.

When a computer system runs multiple programs or processes simultaneously, each program requires a certain amount of memory to store its instructions and data. However, the physical RAM has a limited capacity, and if it becomes insufficient to accommodate all the running processes, the operating system uses swap memory to compensate for the shortage.

➤ Q.6 (Ans) - To determine the cache hit rate for the given sequence of inputs using a cache of size 3, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty cache of size 3.
2. Start processing the input sequence one by one.
3. For each input number, check if it is already present in the cache (a cache hit).
   - If it is a cache hit, increment the cache hit counter and move the number to the front of the cache (to indicate it was recently accessed).
   - If it is not present in the cache (a cache miss), proceed to the next step.
4. If there is space available in the cache (less than 3 numbers present), add the input number to the front of the cache.
5. If the cache is full (all 3 slots are occupied), remove the least recently used (LRU) number from the cache (the one at the back) and add the input number to the front.
6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for the remaining input numbers.
7. Calculate the cache hit rate by dividing the total number of cache hits by the total number of inputs and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.

Let's go through each step using the given input sequence: 5 4 3 2 1 3 5 6 7 8 10 15

1. Initialize an empty cache: []
2. Process the first input number, 5:
   - The cache is empty, so it's a cache miss. Add 5 to the cache: [5].
3. Process the second input number, 4:
   - Cache miss. Add 4 to the cache: [5, 4].
4. Process the third input number, 3:
   - Cache miss. Add 3 to the cache: [5, 4, 3].
5. Process the fourth input number, 2:
   - Cache miss. Replace the LRU number, 5, with 2: [4, 3, 2].
6. Process the fifth input number, 1:
   - Cache miss. Replace the LRU number, 4, with 1: [3, 2, 1].
7. Process the sixth input number, 3:
   - Cache hit. Increment the cache hit counter and move 3 to the front: [3, 2, 1].
8. Process the seventh input number, 5:
   - Cache hit. Increment the cache hit counter and move 5 to the front: [5, 3, 2].
9. Process the eighth input number, 6:
   - Cache miss. Replace the LRU number, 3, with 6: [5, 2, 6].
10. Process the ninth input number, 7:
   - Cache miss. Replace the LRU number, 5, with 7: [2, 6, 7].
11. Process the tenth input number, 8:
   - Cache miss. Replace the LRU number, 2, with 8: [6, 7, 8].
12. Process the eleventh input number, 10:
   - Cache miss. Replace the LRU number, 6, with 10: [7, 8, 10].
13. Process the twelfth input number, 15:
   - Cache miss. Replace the LRU number, 7, with 15: [8, 10, 15].

The cache hit rate can be calculated as the number of cache hits (2) divided by the total number of inputs (12), multiplied by 100:
(2 / 12) * 100 =

➤ Q.7 (Ans) - Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique used in computer systems, particularly in distributed caching systems, content delivery networks (CDNs), and peer-to-peer networks. It provides a scalable and efficient way to distribute data across multiple nodes in a distributed system.

➤ Q.8 (Ans) - When you type "www.attainu.com" in a web browser and press Enter, several steps are involved in resolving the website and displaying its content. Here's a simplified overview of the process:

1. URL Parsing: The web browser parses the URL ("www.attainu.com") to extract different components such as the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), domain name (attainu.com), and any additional path or query parameters.

2. DNS Lookup: The browser checks its cache to see if it has the IP address corresponding to the domain name "attainu.com". If the IP address is not found in the cache, the browser sends a DNS (Domain Name System) request to a DNS server. The DNS server responsible for the domain "attainu.com" is contacted to obtain the IP address associated with it.

3. TCP Handshake: Once the IP address is obtained, the browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the web server at that IP address. The TCP handshake involves a series of steps to establish a reliable connection between the browser and the server.

4. HTTP Request: After the TCP connection is established, the browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the web server. This request contains the necessary information, such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and any additional data required by the server.

5. Server Processing: The web server receives the HTTP request and processes it. This may involve retrieving data from a database, executing server-side scripts, or handling any other necessary operations based on the specific website's logic.

6. HTTP Response: The server generates an HTTP response containing the requested web page or resource. This response includes a status code (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found), headers with additional metadata, and the actual content of the web page.

7. Content Rendering: The browser receives the HTTP response and begins rendering the content of the web page. It interprets the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code included in the response to display the page correctly.

8. Additional Resource Retrieval: While rendering the web page, the browser may encounter additional resources such as images, stylesheets, or JavaScript files referenced within the HTML. The browser then sends separate requests to fetch these resources from the server.

9. Displaying the Web Page: As the browser receives the additional resources, it progressively displays the web page, rendering the text, images, and interactive elements according to the provided instructions in the HTML and CSS code.

10. User Interaction: Once the web page is fully loaded and displayed, the user can interact with the content, click on links, submit forms, or perform any other actions supported by the web page.

➤ Q.9 (Ans) - Context switching refers to the process of saving and restoring the state of a running process or thread in a multitasking operating system. It allows the operating system to efficiently manage and switch between multiple processes or threads, giving the illusion of concurrent execution on a single processor.

➤ Q.10 (Ans) - The TCP/IP model, also known as the Internet protocol suite, is a conceptual framework used for understanding and implementing network protocols in computer networks. It consists of four layers, each responsible for specific functions related to network communication. Let's go through each layer of the TCP/IP model along with examples:

1. Application Layer:
   - The Application Layer provides services directly to the end-users, facilitating communication between networked applications.
   - Examples: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email communication, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfer, DNS (Domain Name System) for translating domain names to IP addresses.

2. Transport Layer:
   - The Transport Layer ensures reliable and efficient data transfer between hosts. It provides end-to-end communication services by managing the flow control, error detection, and recovery mechanisms.
   - Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, connection-oriented transmission, while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) provides unreliable, connectionless transmission. TCP is commonly used for applications like web browsing, email, and file transfer, while UDP is used for real-time applications like video streaming and voice over IP (VoIP).

3. Internet Layer:
   - The Internet Layer handles the addressing and routing of data packets across different networks. It encapsulates data into IP (Internet Protocol) packets, adds source and destination IP addresses, and determines the best path for packet delivery.
   - Example: IP (Internet Protocol) is the core protocol of the Internet Layer. It is responsible for addressing and routing packets between different networks, allowing data to traverse the internet.

4. Network Interface Layer (also known as Link Layer):
   - The Network Interface Layer establishes and maintains communication between devices within the same network. It deals with hardware-specific details such as addressing, packet framing, and error detection at the physical and data link layers.
   - Examples: Ethernet is a widely used network interface protocol that defines how data is transmitted over a local area network (LAN). Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) are other examples of network interface protocols.
